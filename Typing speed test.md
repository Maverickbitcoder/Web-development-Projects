# ⌨️ Typing Speed Test

A fun and interactive web-based **Typing Speed Battle** game that challenges users to test and improve their typing speed and accuracy — all while racing against a "ghost" version of their previous best performance.

## 🚀 Features

- **Typing Speed Measurement (WPM)**: Real-time Words Per Minute calculation.
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Calculates typing accuracy live as you type.
- **Ghost Racing Mode**: Compete with your previous best performance saved in local storage.
- **Multiple Typing Texts**: Randomly selected typing challenges to keep it fresh.
- **Visual Progress Bar**: Dual progress bars to show your typing vs. ghost's.
- **Reset & Replay**: Restart the game easily and try to beat your high score.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean UI that works well on various screen sizes.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. When you click **Start Game**, a random typing paragraph is displayed.
2. You start typing into the text box; the timer counts down from 60 seconds.
3. Your speed and accuracy are calculated and updated every second.
4. A ghost progress bar shows your best historical performance.
5. After 60 seconds or upon completing the paragraph, the game ends.
6. If your performance is better than before, the new best is saved locally.
